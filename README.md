# Quantum Random Number Generator

Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNG) are algorithms that help to create randomness in programs, but they are not truly random like the randomness obtain from physical processes. Quantum Random Number Generator uses a Quantum Computer to generate truly random numbers using fundamental properties of Quantum Physics.
